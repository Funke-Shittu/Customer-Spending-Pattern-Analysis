## Customer Spending Pattern Analysis

### Problem Statement
SellCheapy Retail is a chain of department stores that sells a wide range of products, including cycling products and their components. Despite having a large customer base, the company has been struggling to increase sales in recent years. The aim of this project was to understand the customer spending pattern in order to develop tailored sales and marketing strategies to improve sales.

### Analysis Approach
For this project, the analysis was performed using the following criteria:  

•	Who are our customers, using the recency, frequency & monetary analysis;
•	Identify product pairs frequently bought by customers;
•	When sales spike and dip

#### Market Basket Analysis

The Market Basket Analysis/ Product Pairing was used to understand products customer frequently purchase together in the same transaction. 
The analysis helped us understand that a one-size fit all marketing strategy will not work as the customers fall within different categories.

#### RFM (Recency, Frequency & Monetary) Analysis

Used to segment customers based on; how recently they purchased? How frequently they purchase? and how much they spend?
